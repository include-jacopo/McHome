# McHome - Usability testing protocol and Script 

## User profile
We will recruit participants, among friends of group members, with the following characteristics:
- Age: 19-25 years old (typical university student age)
- Education: Bachelor's or master's degree student
- Gender: Even mix of male and female
- Use smartphone and computer daily for activities (social media, research...) 
- They cook for themselves

## Methodology
### Number of participants
We plan to test the website with five university students.

### Length of session
Each session will be about thirty minutes. The test will include:
- Welcome and test explanation: 8 minutes 
- Task scenarios: 10 minutes  
- Quick debriefing about the test conducted: 4 minutes
- Post-test questionnaire: 8 minutes

### Recording of observations
The facilitator will record the shared screen used by the participant for the test and take screenshots of the highlights. At the same time, the other members of the group will take notes about the test in progress.

### Test artifacts
- Facilitator script
- Consent form - [link to the blank document here](https://github.com/include-jacopo/McHome/tree/main/additional_files/Informed_consent_form.docx)
- Post-test questionnaire (SUS) - [link to the blank document here](https://github.com/include-jacopo/McHome/tree/main/additional_files/Post_test_questionnaire.docx)

## Equipment
During the test carried out in the Zoom call the following equipment will be used:
- Computer with access to internet and Zoom already installed
- Microphone and webcam to connect with the team

Exclusively for our group members:
- Computer with software to record the call 
- Microphone and webcam to connect with the participants 
- Chrome browser with the mobile simulator
- Pens and paper for annotations
- Timer

## Requirements
Since the interviews will be conducted remotely, in order to make it easier to carry out the test and simulate natural conditions of use, the facilitator will share his screen giving participants the possibility to control mouse and keyboard and use our web application in a mobile environment emulator. Moreover, a fake student account will be logged-in and there will be some recipes already added in the favorite ones.

## Script
> **Introduction**
>> Hi, *name of the participant* . I am *name of the facilitator* and before starting I would like to specify that we are here today to test our web application, not you. So to break the ice, how is your day going?

> **State the purpose of the study**
>> First of all, I want to thank you for participating in this study and for installing the software required for the video call. I understand your time is valuable, but hopefully, you find this experience enjoyable.
>>
>> We are performing a usability test on a web application that has the intent of finding student-friendly recipes, called McHome. For the next minutes, we are going to spend time together to get your impressions of this web application. We are going to ask you to complete a series of tasks that match goals typical users like yourself might have when using this website. We are interested in knowing how you do things and what did you think before doing it. 

> **Describe thinking out loud**
>> One important thing we need you to keep in mind while you are testing is that sometimes we need you to “think out loud.” We would like you to express aloud any thoughts about the task you are about to accomplish. I know that sound a little bizarre, but you’ll get used to it quickly. This really helps us understand what is going through your mind while you are using the website. We’re looking for your genuine impressions.
We’re going to watch you complete these tasks, take notes, and we will use our findings to improve the web application in the future.

> **Provide the forms required for participation**
>> Before we proceed with any testing, we need you to complete a video release consent form. As we said when we recruited you for this study, we are going to be screen recording this session, including your webcam. We sent you the document in the zoom video call chat; go ahead and read it, and digital sign it at the bottom if you agree. *Send the form to the user*.

> **Explain the testing process**
>> The way this testing is going to work is that we are going to give you a number of tasks to complete. We will give you the ability to control the computer of which we are sharing the screen right now, as if it were your own. You can move the mouse cursor or type just like you normally would. Each task will have a specific goal, and we want you to explore the website and complete each task.
>> 
>> While you’re using the website, we will watch the screen and you in the call. I will be with you for the entire duration of the test.

> **Ask the participant to share any questions or concerns**
>> So before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns?

> **Start the study**
>> Ok, then we can begin. Do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions.
>> 
>> 1. You are at home, hungry, and with little time, so you browse the web app to find some suggestions based on what you got in the fridge. You are required to search for a recipe containing the ingredient "eggplant".
>> 
>> 2. Well done!/Don't worry if you didn't succeed right away. Now you decide to add some proteins to the dish. Enter a second ingredient, "ham", to refine your search.
>> 
>> 3. Good job. You think it is better to prepare a second. Filter the results to show only these types of dishes.
>> 
>> 4. Ok let's go on. Yesterday you finally got paid for your math tuition to the neighbour's daughter. Filter recipes to show "medium" budget ones.
>> 
>> 5. I think at this point you would be hungry. Finally select a recipe from the suggested list that meets all of these requirements.
>> 
>> 6. Ok, you really liked the dish. So, please, add the recipe to the favorites to save it to prepare it next time with your roommate.
>> 
>> 7. We've almost done. Now, check out what other recipes you have added to your favorites. Check the favorites page, please.
>> 
>> 8. To conclude, you forgot which email you used to sign up for the application. Check it on your profile page.
>>
> Thank you very much for taking this test. We would like to ask you for an initial opinion on the use of the app. Did you find it understandable? Do you like the design? Would you use it on a daily basis? Is there anything you didn't like?
> 
> Thank you. We ask you for a few more minutes of your time to fill in the questionnaire that we sent you in chat, which is really useful to improve our app. Your help is invaluable. *Send the questionnaire via Zoom chat*.
Each question has 5 points option. From "Strongly disagree" to "Strongly agree". We ask you to fill it in and send it to us once finished. Thanks again for your participation.

## Post-test questionnaire (SUS)
